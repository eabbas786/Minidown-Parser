# Minidown Parser

This code parses files formatted in "Minidown", which is a simplified version of Markdown

Minidown is a format that allows:

* Section headings,
* Paragraph text,
* Inline code,
* Displayed code, and
* Bulleted lists.


Once parsed, the input file contents are rendered as HTML in the browser.
